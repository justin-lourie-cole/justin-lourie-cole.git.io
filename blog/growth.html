						>Neuroplasticity is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change
						its activity in response to internal or external stimuli by reorganizing
						its structure, functions, or connections. It was once thought that the
						brain could only change in development but this has been disproven. Though
						the neuroplasticity of a brain in development is much greater than that of
						a fully formed brain, we all have the ability to reshape, develop and
						grow.</p

                            <li><strong>Use it or lose it</strong><br />Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use it and improve it</strong><br>Training that drives a specific brain function can lead to improving abilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specificity</strong><br>The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in the brain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repetition matter</strong><br>Change requires sufficient repetition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intensity matters</strong><br>Change requires intensive training.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time matters</strong><br>Different forms of change in the brain happen at different times during training.</li>
                            <li><strong>Salience matters</strong><br>The training experience must be meaningful to the person in order to cause change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Age matters</strong><br>Training-induced change occurs more readily in younger brains.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transference</strong><br>Change in function as a result of one training experience can even lead to learning other similar skills.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interference</strong><br>Brain changes that result in bad habits can interfere with learning good habits.</li>

                    ><p>By leveraging the knowledge of these principals to perform deliberate practice of meaningful and novel activities, you can effectively give your brains a workout. In doing so, making it stronger and more connected. these activities can include things like learning a new language, learning an instrument or mindfulness. If you can partake in activities and goals that immerse the motor, auditory and visual parts of your brain, you’re more likely to engage your corpus callosum. This’ll increase your bridged connections between your left brain and right brain, which means you’ll become better at solving complex problems and have better coordination.</p><h4>

                    <p><a href="http://secondwindmovement.com/neuroplasticity/">Here</a> is a link to a useful reference detailing steps to increase your neuroplasticity.</p><h4>What is growth mindset?</h4><p>Growth Mindset: “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. Brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck, 2015)</p><p>What's surprising about this is most of our academic life has been based around a static or fixed mindset. That intelligence is a fixed, inborn and unchangeable quality.</p><p>For myself personally, I would like to integrate more of a growth mindset into my learning journey. I think it will be really important to realise that it isn't about not having the ability but not having the ability <strong>yet</strong>. Also, taking on challenges that are at the right level of difficulty for my ability. Something aligned but just a bit of a stretch, as to experience a challenge. By focusing on the process rather than the outcome, my efforts will lead to change, learning and growth both now and in the future.</p>
