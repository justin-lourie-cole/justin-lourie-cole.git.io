					>Just what is the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
					positioning?</h2
				><h4 class="technical">TECHNICAL</h4><br /><h4
					><em><small>written by </small></em>Justin Cole</h4
				><h6>Nov 14 2020</h6><br /><p
					>Admittedly, CSS is definitely one of my weak points. That is why through
					these technical blogs I intend on making my mastery of CSS the focus. To
					try and help myself to understand all the different properties and
					attributes and hopefully illuminate what currently seems to be a
					frustrating roadblock.</p
				><br /><p
					>Firstly, I should start by mentioning static positioning. This is the
					default position attribute each element will have if nothing has been
					specified. With static positioning each element follows directly after one
					another in their natural order (case in point, these paragraphs I am
					typing).</p
				><br /><figure class="image-container"
					><img
						src="../assets/static-position.png"
						alt="position attributes"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><h3>Relative Position</h3><br /><p
					>Relative position allows us to make use of the Top, Bottom, Right and Left
					properties. With our element set to relative position we can now move the
					element in relation to it's original position, say Top: 10px; and Left:
					20px;. This will move the element 10 pixels down from it's top and 20
					pixels right of it's left side (confusing, I know).</p
				><br /><figure class="image-container"
					><img
						src="../assets/relative-position.png"
						alt="position attributes"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><h3>Absolute Position</h3><br /><p
					>Position absolute removes the element from the normal document flow and
					allows for stacking of elements used with the z-index property. The element
					is now able to be positioned in relation to it's closet positioned
					ancestor. If no ancestor has a position property other than default, the
					element will be positioned in relation to the document body. Similar to
					position relative, the Top, Bottom, Left and Right properties inform the
					magnitude.</p

						alt=""
						width="50%"
					/>
				</div>
				<br /><figure class="image-container"
					><img
						src="../assets/absolute-position.png"
						alt="position attributes"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><h3>Fixed Position</h3><br /><p
					>Like position absolute, position fixed removes the element from the normal
					document flow. It is now always fixed in relation to the viewport. Take the
					soon to be navigation bar at the top of this page. Scrolling does nothing
					to affect the position of this element. It is always locked in position at
					the top of the viewport. Once again the Top, Bottom, Left and Right
					properties can be used to inform where this element will be fixed.</p

				><h6>Nov 16 2020</h6><br /><p
					>To start identifying my personal values, probably the easiest inroad is to
					frame them in a professional setting. In my professional career the values
					I identify with and value the most are professionalism, hard work and
					ownership. Having worked with people who lacked these qualities then seeing
					a shift in their attitude, the impact on the culture and success of the
					business these values have is clear as day.</p

					></h4
				><h6>Nov 10 2010</h6><br /><p
					>Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
					his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
					(earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
					distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare
					the hangi.</p

				><br /><p
					>Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
					he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two
					large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey
					over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few
					hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he
					went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
					potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.</p
				><br /><p
					>While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
					stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.</p

						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><p
					>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of
					element it is. The two default display values are: block and inline.</p
				><br /><h3>Display Inline</h3><br /><p
					>An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as
					much width as necessary. Some common inline elements are: </p
				><br /><ul
					><li><span><</span>a<span>></span></li
					><li><span><</span>button<span>></span></li
					><li><span><</span>img<span>></span></li></ul
				><br /><p
					>If an element is given the display attribute of inline or is inline by
					default, the height and width properties will have no effect.</p
				><br /><p>Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!</p
				><br /><figure class="image-container"

				><br /><h3>Display Block</h3><br /><p
					>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full
					width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
					Some common block elements are: </p
				><br /><ul
					><li><span><</span>div<span>></span></li

				><h2>Learning Plan</h2><h4 class="cultural">CULTURAL</h4><br /><h4
					><em><small>written by </small></em>Justin Cole</h4
				><h6>Nov 23 2020</h6><br /><p
					>My long term goal is to become a web developer, be it front end, back end
					or full stack. I would hope to continually learn new skills that I can add
					to my toolbelt. On top this I would hope to meet a few like minded people
					that are sharing a similar journey to my own. To build a better
					understanding of myself and how my current skill set is aligned with the
					current industry standard.</p
				><br /><p>The strengths I possess, in my opinion, are:</p><br /><ul>
					<li>Self motivation and self starter</li>
					<li>Knowledgeable</li>
					<li>Perfectionist</li>
					<li>Life long learner</li>
					<li>Curious</li>
					<li>Insightful</li> </ul
				><br /><p>As far as weaknesses, I would say these are:</p><br /><ul>
					<li>Procrastination</li>
					<li>Lacking mindfulness or easily distracted</li>
					<li>Perfectionist</li>
					<li>Public speaking</li> </ul
				><br /><p
					>With the knowledge of these strengths and weaknesses, to be successful in
					my long term goals I would really need to set myself up with a plan for
					success and the right environment. What this would look like is - setting
					up a quiet environment for myself free of outside distractions. Possibly
					spending half an hour in the morning to plan out what my goals are for that
					day and scheduling time for each goal so I don’t go off on tangents or dive
					too deep into one task. </p
				><br /><p
					>If I do require help and have exhausted all my own mental resources with a
					problem I will see if a similar question has been asked on google or
					stackoverflow OR RTFD (read the #@%$& docs). I can always ask someone in my
					cohort if they are able to help but there is something to be said about
					working through a problem on your own. Down the line full time work may
					crop up so I may need to reassess this plan for success to make it fit
					around any other commitments.</p

				><h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2><h4 class="cultural">CULTURAL</h4

					><img
						src="../assets/EQ-vs-IQ.png"
						alt="90 mile beach"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><p
					>Some psychologists believe that IQ scores are too narrow and do not
					encompass the full range of human intelligence and that intelligence may
					not simply be a single general ability. There may be multiple intelligences
					and people may have strengths in a number of these areas. Some experts
					believe that the ability to understand and express emotions can play an
					equal, if not more important, role in how people fare in life. This is
					known as EQ or emotional intelligence. </p
				><br /><h3>EQ vs IQ</h3><br /><p
					>Today, intelligence quotient is calculated by comparing scores against the
					average scores of people in the same age group. IQ represents such
					abilities as: </p
				><br /><ul>
					<li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
					<li>Knowledge of the world</li>
					<li
						>Fluid reasoning (the brain's ability to take in new information without
						the benefit of practice or experience)</li
					>
					<li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
					<li
						>Quantitative reasoning (the act of understanding mathematical facts and
						concepts and being able to apply them to real-world scenarios)</li
					> </ul
				><br /><p
					>“Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to perceive, control,
					evaluate, and express emotions. ” EQ represents such abilities as: </p
				><br /><ul>
					<li>Identifying emotions</li>
					<li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
					<li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
					<li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
					<li>Using emotions to facilitate social communications</li>
					<li>Relating to others</li> </ul
				><br /><h3>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h3><br />
				<h4
					><em
						>“No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.”
					</em>
					Theodore Roosevelt</h4
				><br /><p
					>According to the Center for Creative Leadership, 75% of careers are
					“derailed for reasons related to emotional competencies, including the
					inability to handle interpersonal problems; unsatisfactory team leadership
					during times of difficulty or conflict; or inability to adapt to change or
					elicit trust”. 67% of attributes that employers look for are emotional
					intelligence competencies. Employees with a manager with high emotional
					intelligence are four times less likely to leave than those with a manager
					with low emotional intelligence. </p
				><br />
				<p
					>High IQ is no guarantee for success in life. In fact the higher you look
					on the business ladder, the abilities associated with EQ are far more
					valuable. As stated earlier, the scope of IQ abilities may be too narrow.
					It will definitely help you to pass that test you have coming up but won’t
					do much to help in the wide range of challenges that arise from working
					with other people.</p
