					>Just what is the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
					positioning?</h2
				><h4 class="technical">TECHNICAL</h4><br /><h4
					><em><small>written by </small></em>Justin Cole</h4
				><h6>Nov 14 2020</h6><br /><p
					>Admittedly, CSS is definitely one of my weak points. That is why through
					these technical blogs I intend on making my mastery of CSS the focus. To
					try and help myself to understand all the different properties and
					attributes and hopefully illuminate what currently seems to be a
					frustrating roadblock.</p
				><br /><p
					>Firstly, I should start by mentioning static positioning. This is the
					default position attribute each element will have if nothing has been
					specified. With static positioning each element follows directly after one
					another in their natural order (case in point, these paragraphs I am
					typing).</p
				><br /><figure class="image-container"
					><img
						src="../assets/static-position.png"
						alt="position attributes"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><h3>Relative Position</h3><br /><p
					>Relative position allows us to make use of the Top, Bottom, Right and Left
					properties. With our element set to relative position we can now move the
					element in relation to it's original position, say Top: 10px; and Left:
					20px;. This will move the element 10 pixels down from it's top and 20
					pixels right of it's left side (confusing, I know).</p
				><br /><figure class="image-container"
					><img
						src="../assets/relative-position.png"
						alt="position attributes"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><h3>Absolute Position</h3><br /><p
					>Position absolute removes the element from the normal document flow and
					allows for stacking of elements used with the z-index property. The element
					is now able to be positioned in relation to it's closet positioned
					ancestor. If no ancestor has a position property other than default, the
					element will be positioned in relation to the document body. Similar to
					position relative, the Top, Bottom, Left and Right properties inform the
					magnitude.</p

						alt=""
						width="50%"
					/>
				</div>
				<br /><figure class="image-container"
					><img
						src="../assets/absolute-position.png"
						alt="position attributes"
						width="100%" /></figure
				><br /><h3>Fixed Position</h3><br /><p
					>Like position absolute, position fixed removes the element from the normal
					document flow. It is now always fixed in relation to the viewport. Take the
					soon to be navigation bar at the top of this page. Scrolling does nothing
					to affect the position of this element. It is always locked in position at
					the top of the viewport. Once again the Top, Bottom, Left and Right
					properties can be used to inform where this element will be fixed.</p

				><h6>Nov 10 2010</h6><br /><p
					>Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
					his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
					(earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
					distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare
					the hangi.</p

				><br /><p
					>Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
					he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two
					large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey
					over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few
					hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he
					went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
					potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.</p
				><br /><p
					>While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
					stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.</p
